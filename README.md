# DTSA 5511 Final Project

## Project Overview
Asset evaluation is very important to stakeholders in the financial industry. Both individual and institutional investors rely on accurate predictions to make informed decisions regarding buying and selling stocks. Traders and fund managers require timely and accurate information to optimize their investment strategies. Accurate price predictions can help mitigate risks, identify investment opportunities, and potentially maximize returns.

The problem with the financial markets is the inherent uncertainty and volatility associated with the price movements in the underlying assets. Predicting these movements is a difficult task due to the variety of factors that influence stock prices, including market trends, economic indicators, company financials, and investor sentiment. The challenge lies in accurately capturing and analyzing these factors to generate reliable predictions. The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model for stock price movements using historical market data. The goal of my model is to uncover patterns and insights that can be used as signals to assist investors and traders in making better informed decisions regarding their investment strategies. My approach involves leveraging deep learning and algorithms to accurately forecast short-term trends in the equities markets.
